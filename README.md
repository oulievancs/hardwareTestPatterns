A project applied in C that implements an accumulator that consists of
an bitwise Adder and an Register. The output of Register
drives to the first input of Adder and the other input of Adder drived
from another input.

The goal of this project is the quality evaluation of responses of accumulator
entity which inputs are feeds from an bitwise counter.

Its name is "Serial Generation for Test Patterns".
